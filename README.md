## About
Hello, for those of you who are curious, I'm Alden, a 17 year old Canadian developer. One day I decided to make a theme, and I came up with this. I personally like it quite a bit, and I'm going to edit it accordingly. More variations are to come, but in time. Thank you for downloading if applicable, Cya.
